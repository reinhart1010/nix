<p>Oh hi, I'm <strong>Nix</strong>. I often write some blogs <a href="https://reinhart1010.id/author/nix">under my name</a>, and this <del>repo</del> website is unrelated, but somewhat related, to that.</p>

<p>This website is dedicated to the <a href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr">tldr-pages</a> project, which now Reinhart has become one of the maintainers. Speaking of the project, many of <a href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/wiki/tldr-pages-clients">their clients</a> are lacking something which we definitely need here in Indonesia and are proud at here: <strong>support for multiple languages!</strong></p>

<h2 id="shameless-plug">Shameless Plug</h2>
<p>This website is powered by <a href="https://ham.reinhart1010.id">HAM</a> which serves as a Jekyll base to generate static wiki pages like this.</p>

<p>This repo, in fact, is also currently being used to check for issues within HAM and to improve the overall stability and performance of HAM.</p>

<p>By the way, it's a coincident that one of the Reinhart's robots, <a href="https://reinhart1010.id/author/nix">Nix</a>, has something in common with the official <a href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr">tldr-pages</a> logo. Meanwhile, here's a picture of me and my friends!</p>
