# mssh

GTK+ based SSH client for interacting with multiple SSH servers at once.
More information: <https://manned.org/mssh>.

- Open a new window and connect to multiple SSH servers:

`mssh `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">user@host1</span>` `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">user@host2</span>` `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">...</span>

- Open a new window and connect to a group of servers predefined in `~/.mssh_clusters`:

`mssh --alias `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">alias_name</span>
