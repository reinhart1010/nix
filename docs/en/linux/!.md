Bash builtin to substitute with a command found in history.
More information: <https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Event-Designators>.

- Substitute with the previous command and run it with sudo:

`sudo !!`

- Substitute with a command based on its line number found with `history`:

`!`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">number</span>

- Substitute with a command that was used specified lines back:

`!-`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">number</span>

- Substitute with the most recent command that starts with `string`:

`!`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">string</span>
