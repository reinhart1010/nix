# scriptreplay

Replay a typescript created by the `script` command to the standard output.
More information: <https://manned.org/scriptreplay>.

- Replay a typescript at the speed it was recorded:

`scriptreplay `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/timing_file</span>` `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/typescript</span>

- Replay a typescript at double the original speed:

`scriptreplay `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/timingfile</span>` `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/typescript</span>` 2`

- Replay a typescript at half the original speed:

`scriptreplay `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/timingfile</span>` `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/typescript</span>` 0.5`
