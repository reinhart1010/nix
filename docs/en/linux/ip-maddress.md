# ip maddress

Manage multicast addresses.
More information: <https://manned.org/ip-maddress>.

- List multicast addresses and how many programs are subscribed to them:

`ip maddress`

- List device specific addresses:

`ip maddress show dev `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">eth0</span>

- Join a multicast group statically:

`sudo ip maddress add `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">33:33:00:00:00:02</span>` dev `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">eth0</span>

- Leave a static multicast group:

`sudo ip maddress delete `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">33:33:00:00:00:02</span>` dev `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">eth0</span>
