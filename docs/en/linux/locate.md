# locate

Find filenames quickly.
More information: <https://manned.org/locate>.

- Look for pattern in the database. Note: the database is recomputed periodically (usually weekly or daily):

`locate `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">pattern</span>

- Look for a file by its exact filename (a pattern containing no globbing characters is interpreted as `*pattern*`):

`locate '*/`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">filename</span>`'`

- Recompute the database. You need to do it if you want to find recently added files:

`sudo updatedb`
