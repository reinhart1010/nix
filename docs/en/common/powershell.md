# powershell

This command may be mistaken as the cross-platform version of PowerShell (formerly known as PowerShell Core), which uses `pwsh` instead of `powershell`.
The original `powershell` command in Windows is still available to use the legacy Windows version of PowerShell (version 5.1 and below).
More information: <https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_pwsh>.

- View the documentation for the command referring to the latest, cross-platform version of PowerShell (version 6 and above):

`tldr pwsh`

- View the documentation for the command referring to the legacy Windows PowerShell (version 5.1 and below):

`tldr powershell -p windows`

- View the documentation for the command referring to the legacy Windows PowerShell in older versions of `tldr` command-line client:

`tldr powershell -o windows`
