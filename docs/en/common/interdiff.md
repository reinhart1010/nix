- Compare diff files:

`interdiff `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">old_file</span>` `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">new_file</span>

- Compare diff files, ignoring whitespace:

`interdiff -w `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">old_file</span>` `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">new_file</span>
