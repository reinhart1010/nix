Create and manage Angular applications.
More information: <https://angular.io/cli>.

- Create a new Angular application inside a directory:

`ng new `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">project_name</span>

- Add a new component to one's application:

`ng generate component `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">component_name</span>

- Add a new class to one's application:

`ng generate class `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">class_name</span>

- Add a new directive to one's application:

`ng generate directive `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">directive_name</span>

- Run the application with the following command in its root directory:

`ng serve`
