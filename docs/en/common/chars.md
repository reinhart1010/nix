# chars

Display names and codes for various ASCII and Unicode characters and code points.
More information: <https://github.com/antifuchs/chars>.

- Look up a character by its value:

`chars '`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">ß</span>`'`

- Look up a character by its Unicode code point:

`chars `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">U+1F63C</span>

- Look up possible characters given an ambiguous code point:

`chars `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">10</span>

- Look up a control character:

`chars "`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">^C</span>`"`
