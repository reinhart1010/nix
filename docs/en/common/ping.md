# ping

Send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts.
More information: <https://manned.org/ping>.

- Ping host:

`ping `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">host</span>

- Ping a host only a specific number of times:

`ping -c `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">count</span>` `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">host</span>

- Ping host, specifying the interval in seconds between requests (default is 1 second):

`ping -i `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">seconds</span>` `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">host</span>

- Ping host without trying to lookup symbolic names for addresses:

`ping -n `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">host</span>

- Ping host and ring the bell when a packet is received (if your terminal supports it):

`ping -a `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">host</span>

- Also display a message if no response was received:

`ping -O `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">host</span>
