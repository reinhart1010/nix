# dolt gc

Search the repository for data that are no longer referenced and no longer needed.
More information: <https://docs.dolthub.com/cli-reference/cli#dolt-gc>.

- Clean up unreferenced data from the repository:

`dolt gc`

- Initiate a faster but less thorough garbage collection process:

`dolt gc --shallow`
