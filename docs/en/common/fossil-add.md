<hr># fossil add

Put files or directories under Fossil version control.
More information: <https://fossil-scm.org/home/help/add>.

- Put a file or directory under version control, so it will be in the current checkout:

`fossil add `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/file_or_directory</span>

- Remove all added files from the current checkout:

`fossil add --reset`
