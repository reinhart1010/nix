Turn a PAM image into an oil painting.
More information: <https://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pamoil.html>.

- Turn a PAM image into an oil painting:

`pamoil `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/input_file.pam</span>` > `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/output_file.pam</span>

- Consider a neighborhood of N pixels for the "smearing" effect:

`pamoil -n `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">N</span>` `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/input_file.pam</span>` > `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/output_file.pam</span>
