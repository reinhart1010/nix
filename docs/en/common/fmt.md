# fmt

Reformat a text file by joining its paragraphs and limiting the line width to a number of characters (75 by default).
More information: <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/fmt>.

- Reformat a file:

`fmt `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/file</span>

- Reformat a file producing output lines of (at most) `n` characters:

`fmt -w `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">n</span>` `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/file</span>

- Reformat a file without joining lines shorter than the given width together:

`fmt -s `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/file</span>

- Reformat a file with uniform spacing (1 space between words and 2 spaces between paragraphs):

`fmt -u `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/file</span>
