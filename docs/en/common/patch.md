# patch

Patch a file (or files) with a diff file.
Note that diff files should be generated by the `diff` command.
More information: <https://manned.org/patch>.

- Apply a patch using a diff file (filenames must be included in the diff file):

`patch < `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">patch.diff</span>

- Apply a patch to a specific file:

`patch `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/file</span>` < `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">patch.diff</span>

- Patch a file writing the result to a different file:

`patch `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/input_file</span>` -o `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/output_file</span>` < `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">patch.diff</span>

- Apply a patch to the current directory:

`patch -p1 < `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">patch.diff</span>

- Apply the reverse of a patch:

`patch -R < `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">patch.diff</span>
