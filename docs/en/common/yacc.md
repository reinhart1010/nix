<hr># yacc

Generate an LALR parser (in C) with a given formal grammar specification file.
See also: `bison`.
More information: <https://manned.org/man/yacc.1p>.

- Create a file `y.tab.c` containing the C parser code and compile the grammar file with all necessary constant declarations for values. (Constant declarations file `y.tab.h` is created only when the `-d` flag is used):

`yacc -d `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/grammar_file.y</span>

- Compile a grammar file containing the description of the parser and a report of conflicts generated by ambiguities in the grammar:

`yacc -d `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/grammar_file.y</span>` -v`

- Compile a grammar file, and prefix output filenames with `prefix` instead of `y`:

`yacc -d `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/grammar_file.y</span>` -v -b `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">prefix</span>
