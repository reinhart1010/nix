- Upload a Google Photos takeout file to Immich server:

`immich-go -server=`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">server_url</span>` -key=`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">server_key</span>` upload `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/takeout_file.zip</span>

- Import photos captured on June 2019, while auto-generating albums:

`immich-go -server=`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">server_url</span>` -key=`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">server_key</span>` upload -create-albums -google-photos -date=`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">2019-06</span>` `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/takeout_file.zip</span>

- Upload a takeout file using server and key from a config file:

`immich-go -use-configuration=`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">~/.immich-go/immich-go.json</span>` upload `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/takeout_file.zip</span>

- Examine Immich server content, remove less quality images, and preserve albums:

`immich-go -server=`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">server_url</span>` -key=`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">server_key</span>` duplicate -yes`

- Delete all albums created with the pattern "YYYY-MM-DD":

`immich-go -server=`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">server_url</span>` -key=`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">server_key</span>` tool album delete `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}</span>
