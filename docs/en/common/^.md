Bash builtin to quick substitute a string in the previous command and run the result.
Equivalent to `!!:s^string1^string2`.
More information: <https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Event-Designators>.

- Run the previous command replacing `string1` with `string2`:

`^`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">string1</span>`^`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">string2</span>

- Remove `string1` from the previous command:

`^`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">string1</span>`^`

- Replace `string1` with `string2` in the previous command and add `string3` to its end:

`^`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">string1</span>`^`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">string2</span>`^`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">string3</span>
