# flutter

Google's free, open source, and cross-platform mobile app SDK.
Some subcommands such as `flutter pub` have their own usage documentation.
More information: <https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/The-flutter-tool>.

- Initialize a new Flutter project in a directory of the same name:

`flutter create `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">project_name</span>

- Check if all external tools are correctly installed:

`flutter doctor`

- List or change Flutter channel:

`flutter channel `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">stable|beta|dev|master</span>

- Run Flutter on all started emulators and connected devices:

`flutter run -d all`

- Run tests in a terminal from the root of the project:

`flutter test `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">test/example_test.dart</span>

- Build a release APK targeting most modern smartphones:

`flutter build apk --target-platform `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">android-arm</span>`,`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">android-arm64</span>
