Expand a bash variable.
More information: <https://gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Shell-Variables>.

- Print a variable:

`echo $`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">VARIABLE</span>

- Print the exit status of the previous command:

`echo $?`

- Print a random number between 0 and 32767:

`echo $RANDOM`

- Print one of the prompt strings:

`echo $`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">PS1|PS2|PS3|PS4</span>

- Expand with the output of `command` and run it. Same as enclosing `command` in backtics:

`$(`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">command</span>`)`
