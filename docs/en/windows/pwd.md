<hr># pwd

In PowerShell, this command is an alias of `Get-Location`.
However, this command is not available on the Command Prompt (`cmd`). Use `cd` instead for similar functionality.
More information: <https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-location>.

`tldr cd`
