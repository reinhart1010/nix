# tuxi

A CLI tool that scrapes Google search results and SERPs that provides instant and concise answers.
More information: <https://github.com/Bugswriter/tuxi>.

- Make a search using Google:

`tuxi `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">search_terms</span>

- Display the search results in [r]aw format (no pretty output, no colors):

`tuxi -r `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">search_terms</span>

- Display only search results (silences "Did you mean?", greetings and usage):

`tuxi -q `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">search_terms</span>

- Display help:

`tuxi -h`
