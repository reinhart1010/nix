# photorec

Deleted file recovery tool.
It is recommended to write recovered files to a disk separate to the one being recovered from.
More information: <https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec>.

- Run PhotoRec on a specific device:

`sudo photorec `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">/dev/sdb</span>

- Run PhotoRec on a disk image (`image.dd`):

`sudo photorec `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">path/to/image.dd</span>
