- Turn on Redshift with 5700K temperature during day and 3600K at night:

`redshift -t `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">5700</span>`:`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">3600</span>

- Turn on Redshift with a manually specified custom location:

`redshift -l `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">latitude</span>`:`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">longitude</span>

- Turn on Redshift with 70% screen brightness during day and 40% brightness at night:

`redshift -b `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">0.7</span>`:`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">0.4</span>

- Turn on Redshift with custom gamma levels (between 0 and 1):

`redshift -g `<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">red</span>`:`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">green</span>`:`<span class="tldr-var badge badge-pill bg-dark-lm bg-white-dm text-white-lm text-dark-dm font-weight-bold">blue</span>

- Turn on Redshift with a constant unchanging color temperature:
