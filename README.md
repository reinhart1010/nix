# Welcome to Nix, yet another **`tldr-pages`** web client.

The original [tldr-pages] project is made to simplify long and (often) tedious command-line documentation into something which is short and memorable. It has several clients to let people learn about these commands from everywhere, from the abyss of the command-line interface to the simplicity of mobile apps.

However, when it comes to web-based clients, many of them are lacking something which we are proud at here: **Support for multiple languages**!

This website is powered by [HAM](https://ham.reinhart1010.id) which serves as a Jekyll base to generate static wiki pages like this. By the way, it's a coincident that one of the Reinhart's robots, [NIx](https://reinhart1010.id/author/nix), has something in common with the official [tldr-pages] logo.
