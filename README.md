# Yet another **`tldr-pages`** web client.

![Nix](https://reinhart1010.id/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bust-nix-300x300.png)

Oh hi, I'm **Nix**. I often write some blogs [under my name](https://reinhart1010.id/author/nix), and this ~~repo~~ website is unrelated, but somewhat related, to that.

This website is dedicated to the [tldr-pages] project, which now Reinhart has become one of the maintainers. Speaking of the project, many of [their clients](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/wiki/tldr-pages-clients) are lacking something which we definitely need here in Indonesia and are proud at here: **support for multiple languages!**

## Shameless Plug
This website is powered by [HAM](https://ham.reinhart1010.id) which serves as a Jekyll base to generate static wiki pages like this.

This repo, in fact, is also currently being used to check for issues within HAM and to improve the overall stability and performance of HAM.

By the way, it's a coincident that one of the Reinhart's robots, [Nix](https://reinhart1010.id/author/nix), has something in common with the official [tldr-pages] logo. Meanwhile, here's a picture of me and my friends!
